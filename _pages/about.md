<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year CS Ph.D. Student at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu). I got my master's degree from [The Chinese University of Hongkong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), advised by Prof. [Xiaoguang Han](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z-rqsR4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

I was previously a research intern at [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/research-areas?language=en) for 5 wonderful months. I was previously a Visiting Student working with Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p9-ohHsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at [UC Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/) and Prof. [Chao Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=syoPhv8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at [AI Institute](https://ai.sjtu.edu.cn), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I work closely with Dr. [Lu Qi](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=SSI90d4AAAAJ&hl=en), Dr. [Xiangtai Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FL3ReD0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at **Tiktok**. I was previously a Research Assistant at AI Thrust, [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Junwei Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bMedjfUAAAAJ&hl=en). I also work closely with Dr. [Peijie Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TqS6s4gAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at **HKUST(GZ)**.

My previous research experience mainly lies in Video Prediction.

My long-term research interests lie in:

* Multimodal Large Language Models
* Video Understanding
* Unfied Understanding and Generation Model
* Visual Tokenzier
